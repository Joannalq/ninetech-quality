#### function test

3, Search companies:

- 3-1 Enter less than 3 characters. It shows "Please enter more than 3 characters". It does not make sense as most ASX code consists of 3 characters. In fact, the results shows up once 3 characters are entered. It should read "Please enter 3 or more characters" instead.

- 3-2 Enter three spaces. It shows "No companies found". It is better still to show "Please enter 3 or more characters" because no letter is input.

- 3-5 Enter long string. If enough number of characters are entered, it will overlap the clear button and the search button at the end of the search field.

- 3-6 Enter the valid company name or ASX code, and then delete and reenter again. When the valid input was made the first time, the results appeared corrected. However, when the input is cleared and same input is entered again, it shows "No companies found" instead. This is not rectified until 4 or more characters are entered into the search field.

- 3-7 Enter two spaces and then enter the correct company's name, after that delete the company's name part and enter another company name. repeat the deleted name and input the company's name several times. The drop-down menu does not change to related lists even if the company's names are quite different.

- 3-8 Enter the special character only like "#" and it could show some result in the drop-down menu.

- 3-9 Enter the company's name correctly and then click the search button. it cannot enter the company's news page. It only works when click the the result from drop-down menu, which need to confirm with client whether it is their requirement.
